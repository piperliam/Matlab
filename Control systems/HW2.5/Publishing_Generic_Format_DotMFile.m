%% Problem X

clc; close all; clear all;
% Perhaps initialize the problem here somewhere or start defining variables

%% 
% *Method:* You can include or start mentioning the method somewhere in
% here. We can write equations in LaTeX typesetting such as in the example
% that I will show here: $C_{L}=\frac{2L}{\rho V^{2}S}$. Pay particular
% attention to the spaces and the method here. If you delete the "percent"
% symbols in line 6, what happens to the published script? What happens if
% you delete the space between the next line and the percent symbol? What
% happens if you delete the asterisks in line 7?

% Code implementation. You can replace this line with more code
% implementation.

%%
% *Results:* You can, perhaps, include this right before including a plot
% or a set of command window printing. I will include a random example just
% to get some idea across.

x=0:1:10;
y=2*x;
plot(x,y)
grid on;
title('Random Linear Plot')
xlabel('x_{rand}')
ylabel('y_{rand}')

%%
% *Discussion:* This is simply providing some skeleton that you may be able
% to work with on future assignments. This allows you to create some markup
% without having to create or compile images together. If you want to
% publish a single pdf file, you may have to be careful in creating
% variables and running the script, but it is possible to include more than
% 1 problem here.

%% Problem X2

% Redefine or initialize values for this problem

%%
% *Method* You can basically reapeat what was done above for the Results
% and Discussion all in the same file if you want to minimize the number of
% files that are merged together.
